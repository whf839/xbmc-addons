# Introduction #
Now that you have installed the Cinema Experience add-on, now you need some trivia slides and video clips that can be played in front of your movie

# Trailers #
While Cinema Experience can play trailers you have in your movie library, it can also play current trailers available online. You can configure the script to use trailers available in the Apple Movie Trailers Lite add-on, but if your internet connection is choppy the experience can be ruined.

The following programs download the latest trailers from the internet and store them on your server.
